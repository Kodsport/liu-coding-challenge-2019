\problemname{BAAS}

BAAS (Build Airplanes As-a-Service) has grand plans to build lots of airplanes.
Naturally airplane construction process consists of multiple, each of which may take some time.
Some steps can take more time to complete than others, e.g. attaching a plane wing may take longer than spray-painting a BAAS logo on the tail.
Furthermore, some steps must to be completed before others can commence. For instance the hull needs to be assembled before the wings can be attached.

BAAS is trying very hard to be the market leader.
Since the customers value a speedy delivery, BAAS has decided to invest in their R\&D department with the goal to decrease the delivery time.
The chief scientist of BAAS is very optimistic and thinks that he his departmen can reduce the time it takes to complete one step to 0.
However, since the money is always tight in the research sector at BAAS, he could only promise to elliminate only one of the construction steps.
As the CEO of BAAS, your role naturally implies figuring out which step you would like to elliminate to achieve as short contruction time as possible.
It goes without saying that as the CEO you have complete access to the BAAS's secret contruction process blueprints.
