\problemname{Diverse Cookies}
Is a world without cookies really worth living in?
Alf and Beata does not think so.
That's why the spent the entire weekend baking an enormous amount of cookies.
They baked $A$ almond biscuits, $B$ butter cookies and $C$ chocolate macarons.

It is now time to eat all these delicious cookies with their friends.
The cookies will be divided up among all the friends.
However, this division must be done such that everyone can eat all of their cookies without having to eat the same kind of cookie twice in a row,

Furthermore, Alf and Beata wants as few cookies as possible to go to waste -- they spent a lot of time preparing them, after all.
Can you determine the maximum amount of cookies that can be distributed among everyone?

\section*{Input}
The first and only line contains four integers $N$ ($2 \le N \le 10^9$), the number of friends eating cookies including Alf and Beata, and $A$, $B$ and $C$ ($0 \le A, B, C \le 10^9$), the amount of cookies of each of the three times Alf and Beata baked.

\section*{Output}
Output a single integer -- the number of cookies Alf and Beata are able to distribute.
