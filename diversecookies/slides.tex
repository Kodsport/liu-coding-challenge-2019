  \section*{Problem}
  We have $A$, $B$ and $C$ cookies of different kinds.
  How many cookies can we distribute to $N$ people such that nobody have to eat the same kind of cookie twice in a row?

  \frametitle{D -- Diverse Cookies}
  \section*{Solution}
  WLOG, assume $A \le B \le C$.

  When can a single person not eat all cookies? When $A + B < C + 1$. 
  Otherwise, we could eat cookies in a $$C, B, C, B, \dots C, B, C, A, C, B, C, A, \dots A, B, A, B$$ pattern.

  \section*{Solution}
  Assume a single person can not eat all cookies, i.e. $A + B < C + 1$.
  
  That person can then eat all $A$ and $B$ cookies and $A + B + 1$ type $C$ cookies.

  Then, the remaining $N - 1$ people can eat a single $C$ cookie.

  In total, they can eat
  $$A + B + \min(C, A + B + N)$$
  cookies.
