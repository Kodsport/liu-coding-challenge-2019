  \section*{Problem}
  Input: A few tables of equal size which consist of two distinct symbols (ON and OFF).

  We have to divide these into the minimal number of groups such that the values in each group have either ON or OFF on each table.

  Task: find the minimal number of such groups.

  \section*{Solution}

  Minimzing number of groups $\rightarrow$  Each group should be as large as possible.

  Pixels can belong to the same group iff their ON and OFF states are the same across all of the images.

  Create a boolean array (e.g. bitset) for each pixel. Each distinct array will then represent each distinct group.
