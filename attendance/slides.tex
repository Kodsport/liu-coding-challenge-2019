  \section*{Problem}
  Given an inital stack of integers, how can we pop integers in a specifiend order using minimal number of operations, where after each operation we can re-insert the popped item back into the stack at an atbitrary position.

  \section*{Solution}
  \textbf{Key insight}: we can always insert the name back into the queue in such way that it will always be used to strike the name of the list when it appears again.
  This implies $$M \leq a_{operations} \le M + N$$
  The problem is then reduced to: given a name that we have \textit{popped} from the stack, find its next occurance in the required sequence. This might also require finding any existing subsequence within the inital stack.
